This is the GUI framework GTK++, built on GTK to include tightly
integrated OpenGL support. The goal is the create a simple to use and
understand framework that has true UTF-8 support and direct OpenGL
integration that is true to the C++ style. This library is a little
more heavy-weight than just a wrapper given it implements suits of
common tasks as single functions rather than a sequence of calls
that need to be learned.

The code is formatted to play nice with editors that don't understand
the spaces-for-tabs format. It should not matter what your tab width
is set to, I use 4 but 2 and 8 should look good too.

The Makefile has four overridable variables:
GCC - controls how GCC is configured, a typical value for this
	variable for a 64-bit build is
GCC="gcc -m64 -fPIC -DPIC"
DEBUG - controls whether the build is to be a debug build,
	defaults to '0' which means no
NOGL - controls whether OpenGL support will be switched on
	for the build. '0', which means no, is the default and
	switches OpenGL support on
LIBDIR - controls where the object files and pkgconfig file
	will be installed, defaults to /usr/lib. For a 64-bit build, it is
	recomended to set this as
LIBDIR=/usr/lib64

The library is currently somewhere between being in alpha and beta
release stages. It is recognised that significant work needs to be
done in order to complete the library enough for an initial release.
This is especially of GTKFont and introducing more OpenGL versions of
widgets where it makes sense.
